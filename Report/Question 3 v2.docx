Question 3:
In this question, we used our data on player performances during the past ten years to better understand the factors that determine players' salaries. Classical linear regression techniques cannot necessarily take advantage of time-dependent variables measured on different entities. Therefore, a panel regression is more suited for this problem.
We recall the hypothesis of panel regression:
-	The predictors of the dependent variables have to be independent, or at least not correlated.
-	The panel regression can only find the role of time-dependent predictors in the value observed for the dependent variable X
-	The random model can find the role of time-independent predictors but then unobserved time-independent variable has to be uncorrelated with other predictors
It is quite difficult to know in real life exactly how many variables are correlated, and if they are, how important will be their bias on the regression result. Therefore, our first idea is to keep only the following information about players for each season: age, position, games played, points scored, 3-points average, number of assists, number of steals, total rebounds, Win-Loss percentage of team during season; and some dummy variables to distinguish players that played exceptionally well during each season: championship winner member, championship runner-up member and best points, rebounds, assists, win-shares performance during the whole championship.
All these variables are time-invariant. Indeed, as we saw in question 2, height and weight have little correlation with players' salaries; therefore we decided not to include them in this panel data. Moreover, fixed effect model couldn't take advantage of these variables. The dummy variables we introduced aim at separating exceptional players from others, since we think that salaries do not necessarily depend linearly on performances but also on player's fame, which can be less rational.
The data we use consists in players that have been active in the past 10 seasons (i.e. from 2004-2005 to 2014-2015) for at least 8 seasons. This limitation aims at reducing the bias resulting from unbalanced data. After removing players who do not match these criteria, we have still 202 players for 1907 observations.
The result of the panel regression is shown here:

We understand that this is unbalanced panel due to players having their debut seasons on different seasons in the past decade. Nevertheless, we see some unwanted results here: the more a player plays (coeff of G), the less he is paid. We also see that the better a player’s team performs (coeff of WL_percentage), the less this player earns. We cannot be satisfied with this regression. Thus, we remove variables that produce these errors and see if the variables that were detected as good predictors are still predictors after our model's transformation:

We find in this new regression the same predictors as before. Thus, we can feel disturbed to have removed the "number of games played" variable. Thus, we observe that even if we put this variable in the list of predictors, the regression will also conclude that TopPerformerWinShares, Age, and PTS have significant influence on our outcome variable – salary (i.e. Pr(>|t|) < 0.05) – and are probably good predictors of players' salary. We also tried to many other combination of predictors, trying to replace variables by other variables with which they could be correlated (e.g. 2-points scored with total points scored) but we always found that these three variables are the best predictor of players' salaries.
We also tried a random model regression by including the time-invariant variables height and weight but the Hausman test always gave us that the fixed effect model was better.
In conclusion, we suggest that the most important factor in players' salaries is age of players (which corresponds to their experience) and the number of points they score in one season. As we initially suggested, there is also an exception in player's salaries: players that have the best statistics for win shares in the championship are usually paid 4M$ than others. In concrete terms, team owner should considerate that one year of experience in a player is worth 400k$. If a player score more points than usual, he could also give bonus up to 5000$ per point. Finally, owner of the best teams should reward their top performer with a bonus of 4M$.







n our project, we had the following information about players and teams for each season:
-	Player's position in team
-	Player's personal information : height, weight, age, experience
-	Player's global data: games played, minutes played, points scored
-	Detailed number of points : field goals scored/attempted/average, 3-points scored/ attempted/average, 2-points scored/attempted/average 
-	Behavior during games  : assists, steal, block, turnover, personal foul
-	Information about team's result : Win, Losses, Win-Loss percentage, Finish, Playoffs, Coaches, Top Win-Share player
-	Information about winners, runner-up and best points/rebounds/assists/win-shares performer
